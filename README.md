# Task Manager - Chloe Stogsdill

### Synopsis:
This application uses hibernate, javafx, and sqlite to create and store a persisting 
database of users and their tasks. My goal for this is to become more fluent in 
hibernate, SQL, and front-end UI. I also like managing tasks and making to-do
lists, of which is why this project was specifically chosen. 

### To Run:
Great question. (Work in progress)
